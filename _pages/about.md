I am a third-year PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/research/centres/robotics-institute">Robotics Institute</a>, University of Technology Sydney, supervised by <a href="https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Liang.Zhao">A/Prof. Liang Zhao</a> and <a href="https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Shoudong.Huang">Prof. Shoudong Huang</a>. My research focuses on autonomous roboticsâ€”specifically, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), 3D reconstruction, and state estimation algorithms.
