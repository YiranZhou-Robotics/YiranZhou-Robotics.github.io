  abstract= {Multiview point cloud registration is a fundamental task for constructing globally consistent 3D models. Existing approaches typically rely on feature extraction and data association across multiple point clouds; however, these processes are challenging to obtain global optimal solution in complex environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel correspondence-free multiview point cloud registration method. Specifically, we represent the global map as a depth map and leverage raw depth information to formulate a non-linear least squares optimisation that jointly estimates poses of point clouds and the global map. Unlike traditional feature-based bundle adjustment methods, which rely on explicit feature extraction and data association, our method bypasses these challenges by associating multi-frame point clouds with a global depth map through their corresponding poses. This data association is implicitly incorporated and dynamically refined during the optimisation process. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy, particularly in challenging environments where feature extraction and data association are difficult. },

  abstract={Patch-based approaches to regenerating damaged myocardium include epicardial surgical transplantation of heart patches. By the time this therapy is ready for widespread clinical use, it may be important that patches can be delivered via minimally invasive and robotic surgical approaches. This brief research report describes a world-first minimally invasive patch transplantation surgical device design enabled for human operation, master-slave, and fully automated robotic control.},
